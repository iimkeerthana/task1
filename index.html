 	<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.

Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a M

<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who is famously known as Mahatma Gandhi was more than just a lawyer. He is remembered as an anti-colonial nationalist as he was the leader in India's independence movement. His non-violent tactics became famous around the world and influenced some freedom fighters around the world including Martin Luther King.

Gandhi's education was met with challenges right from elementary school up to college. Despite these challenges, he managed to accomplish his goals and inspire many people around the world. Here is a brief overview of Mahatma Gandhi's life during his school years.

Primary Education
Where was Gandhi educated? He received his primary education in the city of Porbandar. Being a famous and influential person, some people assume Gandhi was among the brightest students in his school. Contrary to this, Gandhi was an average student. He was not very good at academics or in any sporting activities, however, he grasped some of the most important aspects of his education including good morals. He was also a shy and timid student. The school he went to was a school consisting of boys only and was located on the Western Coast of India.

High School Education

Gandhi later moved to Rajkot, a city located in the western part of India. The move was necessary due to his father's new job. He joined Alfred High School, an all-boys school, at the age of 11 years. There was a lot of improvement in his performance in high school compared to elementary school.

The young Gandhi who was not good at anything could now be recognized as a good student in various subjects including English. He did not excel in other areas such as Geography. He was still the same shy student but he still maintained the good conduct he had from a very young age. One thing that never changed was his handwriting. It was never pleasing. This is probably due to the fact that he learned by writing on dust using his fingers.

His high school life was a challenge since he married at 13 years and had to take care of his family. His father later got ill which was added a challenge to his life as well as his education.

Alfred High School was later renamed after Gandhi after India's independence. In 2017, the school was closed and converted to a museum.

	<p>When he moved to South Africa in 1893, Gandhi quickly encountered racial discrimination. In a Durban court he was asked by the European magistrate to take off his turban; he refused and left the courtroom. A few days later, while traveling to Pretoria, he was thrown out of a first-class railway compartment and was later beaten up by the white driver of a stagecoach because he would not travel on the footboard to make room for a European passenger. He was also barred from hotels reserved “for Europeans only.” But something happened to Gandhi as he smarted under the insults heaped upon him. That journey from Durban to Pretoria was his moment of truth. Henceforth he would not accept injustice. He would defend his dignity as an Indian and as a man. Gandhi fought with mixed success against South Africa’s system of discrimination. He founded the Natal Indian Congress, and his writings exposed to the world the injustices suffered by Indians and others. In 1906 satyagraha (“devotion to truth”) was born as a technique of nonviolent resistance. By the time Gandhi returned to India in 1915, he had developed satyagraha into an effective tool in the fight for social justice.
Achieving India’s Independence

By 1920 Gandhi was India’s dominant political figure, exerting a broad influence over the Indian population. The Indian National Congress (Congress Party) became a mass organization that Gandhi led in nonviolent actions. These included boycotts of British goods as well as British legislatures, courts, offices, and schools. In 1930 Gandhi launched the Salt March as a protest against a British tax on salt. The march was one of the most successful of Gandhi’s campaigns. Yet by 1934 he had become disillusioned with the infighting among Congress Party members. He turned to building the nation “from the bottom up.” By emphasizing rural education, social equality, and cottage industries, Gandhi believed India could become peaceful and self-sufficient. The final struggle for Indian independence began in 1942. Gandhi demanded an immediate British withdrawal from India, known as the Quit India Movement. Over the next five years Gandhi struggled to help Muslim, Hindu, and British leaders negotiate Indian independence. He was unable to block the Mountbatten Plan, which divided the subcontinent into a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority East and West Pakistan. On August 15, 1947, India achieved its independence. Gandhi worked to stop the Muslim-Hindu riots that followed. On January 30, 1948, he was assassinated by a Hindu radical who was upset by Gandhi’s efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims.
